    <h1>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</h1>

    <p>It doesn't look so shiny to me. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! They're like sex, except I'm having them! It must be wonderful. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</p>
    <p>That's not soon enough! <strong> They're like sex, except I'm having them!</strong> <em> I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</em> When will that be?</p>

    <h2>A sexy mistake.</h2>
    <p>Hey, whatcha watching? Bender, we're trying our best. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</li>
      <li>Hello Morbo, how's the family?</li>
      <li>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</h3>
    <p>But existing is basically all I do! And until then, I can never die? I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shut up and get to the point!</li>
      <li>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</li>
      <li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shut up and get to the point! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Bender, quit destroying the universe! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</p>
    <p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Professor, make a woman out of me. You don't know how to do any of those.</p>
    <p>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. I love you, buddy! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
    <p>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? You can see how I lived before I met you. A sexy mistake. I love you, buddy! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
    <p>Do a flip! You're going to do his laundry? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</p>
    <p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I can explain. It's very valuable. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
    <p>You don't know how to do any of those. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
    <p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
    <p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Bender?! You stole the atom. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it.</p>
    <p>With gusto. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! One hundred dollars. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
    <p>I just told you! You've killed me! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>
